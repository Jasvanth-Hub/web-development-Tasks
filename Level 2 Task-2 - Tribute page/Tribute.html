            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <img src="./Images/intro.jpeg" alt="Introduction Image">
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose, popularly known as Netaji, was a prominent Indian nationalist leader who played a
                key role in India's struggle for independence against British rule. He was born on January 23, 1897, in
                Cuttack, Odisha, India. Bose is admired for his unwavering dedication to the cause of Indian
                independence and his fearless leadership in challenging the colonial authorities.</p>
            <p>He also led an Indian national force from abroad against the Western powers during World War II. He was a
                contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi, at times an ally and at other times an adversary. Bose was known in
                particular for his militant approach to independence and for his push for socialist policies.</p>
            <p>Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj. The
                early recipient of an Anglo-centric education, after college he was sent to England to take the Indian
                Civil Service examination.</p>
            <p>He succeeded with distinction in the first exam but demurred at taking the routine final exam, citing
                nationalism as a higher calling. Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist movement led by
                Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group
                within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more open to socialism. Bose became
                Congress president in 1938. </p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <img src="./Images/early_life.png" alt="Early Life Image">
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was born into a prominent Bengali family. He studied at Ravenshaw Collegiate School
                in Cuttack and later attended Presidency College in Calcutta (now Kolkata). Bose excelled academically
                and was deeply influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and the Indian Nationalist movement.</p>
            <p>Bose joined the noncooperation movement started by Mohandas K. Gandhi, who had made the Indian National
                Congress a powerful nonviolent organization. Bose was advised by Gandhi to work under Chitta Ranjan Das,
                a politician in Bengal. There Bose became a youth educator, journalist, and commandant of the Bengal
                Congress volunteers. His activities led to his imprisonment in December 1921. In 1924 he was appointed
                chief executive officer of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, with Das as mayor.</p>
            <p>Bose was soon after deported to Burma (Myanmar) because he was suspected of connections with secret
                revolutionary movements. Released in 1927, he returned to find Bengal Congress affairs in disarray after
                the death of Das, and Bose was elected president of the Bengal Congress. </p>
            <p>Shortly thereafter he and Jawaharlal Nehru became the two general secretaries of the Indian National
                Congress. Together they represented the more militant, left-wing faction of the party against the more
                compromising, right-wing Gandhian faction.</p>

            <h2>Contribution to Indian Independence</h2>
            <img src="./Images/Contribution.jpeg" alt="Contribution Image">
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose's contribution to India's independence movement is immense. He served as the
                president of the Indian National Congress in 1938 and 1939 but later resigned due to ideological
                differences with the party leadership. Bose believed in more radical methods to achieve independence and
                eventually formed the Forward Bloc within the Congress.</p>
            <p>One of Bose's most significant contributions was the formation of the Indian National Army (INA) in 1942,
                with the support of Imperial Japan and the Axis powers during World War II. The INA aimed to liberate
                India from British rule through armed struggle. Bose's leadership and charisma inspired thousands of
                Indian soldiers to join the INA and fight alongside the Japanese forces against the British.</p>

            <h2>Leadership Style and Ideology</h2>
            <img src="./Images/leadership.jpeg" alt="Leadership Image">
            <p>Leadership is the ability to influence an individual or a group towards the accomplishment of goals in a
                given situation. Leaders are visionaries with a poorly developed sense of fear and no concept of the
                odds against them. In this competitive era when people are busy to fulfill their self interest only, the
                existence of visionary leader is reducing dramatically. Incredible India has produced many great
                leaders, since its ancient times.</p>
            <p>The study on their lives will always be inspiring to present generation for dedicating themselves towards
                the betterment of nation in all respect. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was the great freedom fighter whose
                action motivated Indian youths to be active and awaken and which ultimately forced British government to
                rethink for India’s independence.</p>
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was known for his charismatic leadership and unwavering commitment to the cause of
                Indian independence. He espoused a socialist ideology and envisioned a free India based on principles of
                equality and justice for all. Bose's leadership style was marked by his courage, determination, and
                willingness to make sacrifices for the greater good of the nation.</p>
